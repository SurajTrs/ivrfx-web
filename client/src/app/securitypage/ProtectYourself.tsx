                Fraudsters commonly attempt to obtain your personal information by impersonating a trusted company and/or
                presenting themselves as its employees, using similar email domains. Watch out for suspicious emails
                where the domains appear similar to an official source but with a tweak. These emails often contain
                spelling mistakes or improper formatting.

                We urge you to consult the respective countryâ€™s regulator website, before conducting business with any investment
                firms, to ascertain which entities are licensed to provide investment services and their approved domains. Most
                regulators maintain approved and non-approved domains to help you verify legitimacy.
